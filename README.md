# Second Web Technologies 2 assignment
## ⚡Languages: PHP, HTML, CSS⚡
## ⚡Using: MySQL⚡
This is the second assignment from the Web Technologies 2 class. In this assignment I am able to parse 3 different restaurants
and display their current food menu for the week. Firstly, I parse the data and then insert them into my SQL table 
from where I can display them on my site. I am also able to delete all the parsed data.
## This project had a deadline so there may appear some bugs because of the time limit and my knowledge at that time
