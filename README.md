# Second Web Technologies 2 assignment
## ⚡Languages: PHP, HTML, CSS⚡
## ⚡Using: MySQL⚡
This is the second assignment from the Web Technologies 2 class. In this assignment we parse 3 different restaurants
and we display their current food menu for the week. We parse the data and then insert them into our SQL table 
from where we can display them on our site. We can also delete all the parsed data.
## This project had a deadline so there may appear some bugs because of the time limit and my knowledge at that time
